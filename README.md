This is a small sentiment Analysuis project.Developed Usin NLTK and skelearn.Deployed using Django.
I used Twitter sentimetn dataset to train the model. The models used are logistic regression and naive Bayes variants. The system designed for classification is a voting system, All moedls vote for the target label and then the label with the most confidence is chosen as the label.
